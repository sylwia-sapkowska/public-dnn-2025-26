# Grading rules

* 50 points for homework,
* 50 points for the exam,
* up to 10 *Activity Points* (equivalent to ~+0.5 grade on the final course grade), awarded by lab instructors for extra effort (e.g. solving optional tasks, presenting solved scenarios from previous classes, finding a significantly better solution), up to 2.5 points at a time.

Total: 110 points possible. Grading scale:
* ≥ 90 points : 5.0
* ≥ 80 points: 4.5
* ≥ 70 points: 4.0
* ≥ 60 points: 3.5
* ≥ 50 points: 3.0

To pass, you need to pass both the homework and exam parts, which means reaching at least half of the points.
Lower thresholds for grades and for passing may be announced after grading is done.

## Homework rules
There will be four homework assignments, in the form of larger lab-like scenarios to be solved individually at home.
Each assignment will have a deadline at least one week after publication (at least 2 weeks for more complex tasks).
There may be an uneven distribution of points for the four assignments.

Homework may be submitted within its announced deadline and/or late (until the start of the exam session, so by January 23rd, unless a given homework assignment's graders allow later submissions).

Late submissions have their score multiplied by 0.6, even if you are late by 10 minutes.
(If you are late by less than 10 minutes your score will be multiplied by 0.9.)

## Exam rules
The exam will have two parts:
* Theoretical: quiz with open questions. No materials allowed.
* Programming session. Materials allowed: code written earlier by yourself; internet for documentation and definitions only. Using code assistants or looking for solutions on the internet is not allowed.

**Exam pass**: there will be a free exam pass (with the highest grade) given to some number of students with the top total scores for homeworks (excluding points for lab activity).
This requires getting the last homework scored earlier, so notify the graders that you aim for the exam pass (we will send a reminder about that when HW4 is announced).
